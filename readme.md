# Discord Bot Fun

## Suggested changes

- Function that joins the voice channel and plays a tune for luls, see: https://discordjs.guide/popular-topics/miscellaneous-examples.html#play-music-from-youtube. Could do this based on winning a game, will need to poll the riot API every 5-10 seconds which shouldn't be too bad.

- Get rune sets for champion based on either op.gg or champion.gg
- Get a list of champs with highest winrate for a position.
- Check riot status for all games.
- Poll the riot json files to ensure that we have the most up to date info.
- Create a picture-based message when it comes to ultimate bravery.

## Repository for data
